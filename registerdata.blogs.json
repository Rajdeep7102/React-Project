All of that development means there are some pretty good products out there: that first Oculus evolved into the Quest line at Meta, which is now shipping&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23906313/meta-quest-3-review-vr-mixed-reality-headset\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the Quest 3</a>&nbsp;— a very good VR headset with a huge library of games and some AR features of its own, which costs $500.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>In the meantime, Apple, from Tim Cook on down, has largely insisted that augmented reality will be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21077484/apple-tim-cook-ar-augmented-reality\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">much more valuable than virtual reality</a>.

The goal is for the Vision Pro to be a complete device that can sit right alongside the Mac and the iPad in Apple’s ecosystem of devices and let you get real work done. You can use Excel and Webex and Slack in the Vision Pro, and you can also sit back and watch movies and TV shows on a gigantic virtual 4K HDR display. And you can mirror your Mac’s display and just use the Vision Pro to look at a huge monitor floating in virtual space.</p><p><br></p><h3>Related</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23751675/apple-vision-pro-vr-headset-ios-17-mental-health-mood-journal\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s view of the future is a lonely one</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/18/24043367/apple-vision-pro-apps-good-bad\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vision Pro apps: the good, the bad, and the ridiculous</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23906313/meta-quest-3-review-vr-mixed-reality-headset\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Meta Quest 3 review: almost the one we’ve been waiting for</a></li></ul><p>It sounds amazing, and sometimes it is. But the Vision Pro also represents a series of really big tradeoffs — tradeoffs that are impossible to ignore. Some of those tradeoffs are very tangible: getting all this tech in a headset means there’s a lot of weight on your face, so Apple chose to use an external battery pack connected by a cable. But there are other, more philosophical tradeoffs as well.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>As I’ve been using it for the past few days, I kept coming up with a series of questions — questions about whether the tradeoffs were worth it.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Is using the Vision Pro so good that I’m willing to mess up my hair every time I put it on?</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>Is it so good that I want to lug it around in its giant carrying case instead of my laptop bag?</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>Is it so good that I want to look at the world around me through screens instead of with my own eyes?</em></p><p><br></p><p>Basically, I keep asking if I prefer using a computer&nbsp;<em>in there</em>&nbsp;rather than&nbsp;<em>out here</em>.

But it can also put you in virtual reality, at various levels of immersion: I spent some time working entirely on the Moon and a lot of time in my kitchen with a bunch of windows floating around a portal into Joshua Tree.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Defining “reality” is a messy business in computing. The past decade has seen a dizzying race to come up with new words for what head-mounted displays do, including disagreement over what each one of these phrases means. So here’s our interpretation of a few terms used in the review:</p><p>Augmented reality: virtual projections that are directly related to objects in the physical world, like an automatic translation of a restaurant menu or a virtual poster pinned to a real wall.</p><p>Mixed reality: a computing system that mixes the virtual and physical without direct interaction between the two, like an app window floating in your living room.</p><p>Virtual reality: a computing experience that immerses you in a fully virtual space, deliberately blocking out your perception of the physical world.</p><p>The Vision Pro is stunning compared to other VR headsets, which are largely plastic and often downright goofy-looking. The Vision Pro, by contrast, is built of magnesium and carbon fiber in an aluminum enclosure that feels like a natural extension of Apple’s familiar design language. There’s a little iPhone 6 in there, a little AirPods Max, a little Apple Watch. It is the cutting edge of technology in a package that seems instantly familiar. Almost everyone I’ve shown it to thinks it looks smaller in person than they expected, especially compared to some of the huge VR headsets we’ve seen over the past decade.</p><p><br></p><p>The front display on the Vision Pro is an attempt at keeping you from being isolated from other people while you’re wearing it. In Apple’s photos, it looks like a big, bright screen that shows a video of your eyes to people around you so they feel&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/2/24022803/apple-vision-pro-jony-ive-zoom-eyes-sunglasses-patent\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">comfortable talking to you</a>&nbsp;while you’re wearing the headset — a feature adorably called EyeSight. In reality, it might as well not be there. It’s a low-res OLED with a lenticular panel in front of it to provide a mild 3D effect, and it’s so dim and the cover glass is so reflective, it’s actually hard to see in most normal to bright lighting. When people&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;see your eyes, it’s a low-res, ghostly image of them that feels like CGI. The effect is uncanny — the idea that you’ll be making real eye contact with anyone is a fantasy. And there are no controls or indicators in visionOS for this external display, so you never really know what other people are seeing. Imagine looking someone directly in the eyes and talking to them&nbsp;<em>without knowing if they can see your eyes</em>&nbsp;— it’s weird!</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255977/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0002.jpg\"></p><p><em>EyeSight is so weird. So, so weird.</em>&nbsp;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</p><p>That cover glass hides a huge array of cameras and sensors. There’s a pair of high-res front cameras for the video passthrough, cameras that face down and to the sides to track your hands, a lidar scanner and TrueDepth cameras for spatial tracking, and infrared floodlights so everything can work in low light. Underneath all&nbsp;<em>that,</em>&nbsp;you’ve got an M2 processor and Apple’s new R1 spatial coprocessor and a pair of fans to move the heat from all this tech out the top. The fans were never perceptible during my time testing the Vision Pro, but the heat was: after long sessions, the headset was definitely warm.</p><p><br></p><p>On the top edge, you’ll find what feel like larger versions of some familiar Apple Watch controls: a digital crown that adjusts both the volume and the level of virtual reality immersion on the right as you look through the headset and a button on the left that lets you take 3D photos and videos.</p><p><br></p><p>You get two headbands in the box: the solo knit band and the dual loop band. They both attach and detach easily; you snap them right on and then pull the little orange tab to disconnect them. The solo band is unquestionably cooler and messes up your hair slightly less — but they both mess up your hair, so if the dual loop fits you better, just go with it. I found the solo loop much more comfortable; I also wish the mounting points were on the outside face so I could pull the band around my head and clip it on instead of constantly pulling it over my hair.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1601/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255257/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0576.jpg\"></p><p><em>The front of the Vision Pro is covered in cameras and sensors.</em>&nbsp;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</p><p><img src=\"https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1601/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255991/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0181.jpg\"></p><p><em>The solo loop is by far the cooler strap.</em>&nbsp;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</p><p><img src=\"https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1601/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255998/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0299.jpg\"></p><p><em>The huge case costs an additional $199 and looks like a marshmallow from space. I love it.</em>&nbsp;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</p><p>The other two pieces are the light seal, which comes in various sizes, and the headband, which comes in two thicknesses. (You get fitted for these in the store or by scanning your head with an iPhone if you buy online.) Both attach magnetically, which means they also&nbsp;<em>detach</em>&nbsp;magnetically — you want to pick this thing up by the frame because grabbing it by the light seal can lead to disaster.</p><p><br></p><p>The idea that you’ll be making real eye contact with anyone while wearing the Vision Pro is a fantasy</p><p>If you have glasses, you can click in custom Zeiss lens inserts — Apple sent us reader lenses to see what that process looks like, but I just used the Vision Pro while wearing my soft contacts, and it was fine.</p><p><br></p><p>The Vision Pro’s speakers are housed in the arms on the side, and they are good and loud and do a convincing job of rendering spatial audio. Things really sound like they are happening where they appear to be happening, which is a neat trick. The speakers are also pretty leaky, so everyone else around you can hear what you’re up to unless you use headphones. You can use any Bluetooth headphones you want, but you get a bunch of extra features if you use the latest AirPods Pro, like lower latency, lossless 48KHz audio, and Apple’s Adaptive Audio system, which automatically mixes in sound from the real world as appropriate.</p><p><br></p><p>Since you’ll mostly experience the Vision Pro&nbsp;<em>in there</em>, the most noticeable thing about the hardware after a while is that it’s just… heavy. You’re supposed to wear this thing on your face for long stretches of computer time, and depending on which band and light seal you use, the headset alone weighs between 600 and 650 grams. I keep joking that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but it’s heavier than an 11-inch iPad Pro (470 grams) and pushing close to a 12.9-inch iPad Pro (682 grams), so in a very real way, it’s an iPad for your face.</p><p><br></p><p>All of the Vision Pro’s heft is totally front-loaded, too. Other big headsets like the Quest Pro (722 grams) have elaborate headbands to balance out their weight, but the Vision Pro just rests it all on the front. Swapping to the dual loop strap helps keep things more stable but doesn’t really reduce the overall sensation of having all that headset on your face. You’re just going to feel it after a while.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255186/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0006.jpg\"></p><p><em>The Vision Pro’s external battery pack is fine, mostly because it’s such a stationary device overall.</em>&nbsp;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</p><p>Notably, the Vision Pro is substantially heavier than the familiar Quest 2 (503g) or even the heavier Quest 3 (515g) — headsets that have built-in batteries. Apple told me that it chose to use an external battery specifically to reduce the headset’s weight. The battery itself is barely worth talking about — it’s a silver brick that weighs another 353 grams with a USB-C port and a motion-activated LED that’s green when it’s charged and orange when it’s not. It connects to the headset with a satisfying twist connector, but the nice braided cable is permanently attached to the battery itself, so don’t break it. You can buy extra batteries for $199, but you can’t hot-swap them; disconnecting the battery from the Vision Pro cuts the power entirely.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t really have strong opinions on this battery setup, which is mostly because nothing about the Vision Pro feels like you’re supposed to move around that much in it, so it’s more or less fine. It’s funny that Apple of all companies shipped this compromise, but it’s also very Apple that the battery is not actually bigger so it can provide more than two and a half hours of run time. (If you plug the battery in, the Vision Pro just runs on wall power for as long as you want.)</p><p><br></p><p>Setting up the Vision Pro is dead simple — the headband adjustments are the only manual adjustments involved. Everything else is motorized and sensor-driven. There’s no fiddly lens wheel to dial in; the headset asks you to hold down the digital crown when you first put it on to adjust the lenses to your eyes, and then you go through a pretty standard eye tracking setup. The rest of the setup is almost exactly like any other iOS device: if you have an iPhone, you can bring it close to the Vision Pro to send over all your settings, and you have to agree to some terms and conditions. If you don’t have an iPhone, you’ll have to enter your passwords and so on manually, but it’ll work fine as a standalone device. After all of that, you’re computing in the future.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255244/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0248.jpg\"></p><p><em>See? It’s a VR headset.</em>&nbsp;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</p><p>Apple is very proud of the displays inside the Vision Pro, and for good reason — they represent a huge leap forward in display technology. The two displays are tiny MicroOLEDs with a total of 23 million pixels that are just 7.5 micrometers in size, which is about the size of a red blood cell. And each of&nbsp;<em>those</em>&nbsp;tiny pixels is composed of three RGB subpixels laid out in what Apple tells me is an S-stripe pattern. Just thinking about the level of precision required to make these displays and then make them work in a device like this is mind-blowing.&nbsp;</p><p>They also look generally incredible — sharp enough to read text on without even thinking about it, bright enough to do justice to movies. Apple calibrates them for color at the factory so they are also vibrant and color-accurate without looking oversaturated or blown out. They are&nbsp;<em>so</em>&nbsp;small, but they work&nbsp;<em>so</em>&nbsp;well that they seem huge.</p><p><br></p><p>The displays are the main reason the Vision Pro is so expensive — they’re at the heart of the Vision Pro experience and what makes the whole thing work. You are always looking at them, after all. But for all their technical marvels, they are not without tradeoffs of their own when deployed on a device like this.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255223/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0153.jpg\"></p><p><em>The speakers are nice and loud and convincing with spatial audio.</em>&nbsp;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</p><p>See&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;thing — a passthrough VR headset with a silly external battery pack and a display that shows ghostly images of your eyes on the front — is not the big goal. The big goal is AR, or augmented reality. In particular, the big goal is&nbsp;<em>optical</em>&nbsp;AR, where light passes directly through unobtrusive glasses to your eyes, with digital information layered over the top of what you’re seeing. AR is a technology with the potential to literally change humanity, and Apple CEO Tim Cook has been talking about how isolating VR headsets are and how important he thinks AR will be for years now.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Tim Cook,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2016/10/02/tim-cook-talks-steve-jobs-need-for-encryption-at-utah-tech-tour-video/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2016</a>: “Few people are going to view that it’s acceptable to be enclosed in something.”</li><li>Tim Cook,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/apple-tim-cook-boss-brexit-uk-theresa-may-number-10-interview-ustwo-a7574086.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2017</a>: “Unlike Virtual Reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be present in the world.”</li><li>Tim Cook,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-41590323\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2017</a>: “I also like the fact that [AR] doesn’t isolate [...] I’ve never been a fan of VR like that because I think it does the opposite.”</li><li>Tim Cook,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/tim-cook-ar-war-ducks-healthtech\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2020</a>: “I think [AR is] something that doesn’t isolate people. We can use it to enhance our discussion, not substitute it for human connection, which I’ve always deeply worried about in some of the other technologies.”</li></ul><p>You get the idea.</p><p><br></p><p>The problem is that the technology to build a true optical AR display that works well enough to replace an everyday computer just isn’t there yet. The Magic Leap 2 is an optical AR headset that’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/12/23205702/magic-leap-2-enterprise-release-price-shipping-date-mixed-reality-ar-headset\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">cheaper and smaller</a>&nbsp;than the Vision Pro, but it’s plagued by compromises in field of view and image quality that most people would never accept.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>So Apple’s settled for building a headset with real-time video passthrough — it is the defining tradeoff of the Vision Pro. It is a VR headset masquerading as an AR headset. And let me tell you: the video passthrough on the Vision Pro is&nbsp;<em>really good</em>. It works! It’s convincing. You put the headset on, the display comes on, and you’re right back where you were, only with a bunch of visionOS windows floating around.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>It sounds simple, but it is an astonishing engineering achievement to do that in real time, at high resolution, in a computer that fits over your eyes. Apple claims there’s only 12ms of latency between what the cameras see and what’s on the display, and that latency includes the exposure time of the cameras themselves. The actual data processing is&nbsp;<em>faster</em>. Do the math, and Apple says there’s not even a frame’s worth of latency; the next frame of video is ready before you’re done looking at the last one.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255229/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0194.jpg\"></p><p><em>Still cameras, still displays.</em>&nbsp;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</p><p>You can also see Apple’s incredible video processing chops right in front of your eyes: I sat around scrolling on my phone while wearing the Vision Pro, with no blown-out screens or weird frame rate issues. I also worked on my Mac in front of a large window while wearing the headset, which is a torture test for dynamic range, and while it wasn’t perfect, it was still usable. It is the best video passthrough that’s ever shipped in a consumer device by far.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want me to perceive reality through something, I’d like to see all the colors of the rainbow</p><p>The problem is that cameras are still cameras, and displays are still displays. All cameras have motion blur, for example. In low light, cameras either have to increase exposure times at the cost of sharpness or increase ISO at the cost of noise, which then requires noise reduction, which makes things blurry and dull. And cameras and displays both have real limits in terms of color reproduction.</p><p><br></p><p>The Vision Pro cannot overcome the inherent nature of cameras and displays. You can easily see motion blur when you move your head in the Vision Pro — motion blur that increases in low light and leads to some weird warping of straight lines. Low light also causes the overall sharpness of the video passthrough to drop as noise reduction kicks in: my iPhone screen got noticeably blurrier when the sun set.</p><p><br></p><p>If you’re in a medium-lit room halfway immersed in a dark virtual environment with a bright window open — say, sitting in your kitchen at night with the lights on while writing a review in a Google Docs&nbsp;window floating on a dark beach — you will notice the display brightness slowly ramp up and down as the system tries to average out the brightness of everything you’re looking at. The LCD clock on my microwave flickers when I look at it through these cameras. And Apple’s specs say the display supports 92 percent of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCI-P3\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">DCI-P3 color gamut</a>, which means the Vision Pro can only show you 49 percent of the colors your eyes can actually see.</p><p><br></p><p>Video</p><p><br></p><p>The vision pro's video passthrough did not like the clock on my microwave.</p><p>The displays have other limitations: the field of view isn’t huge, and the essential nature of looking at tiny displays through lenses makes that field of view feel even smaller. Apple won’t tell me the exact number, but the Vision Pro’s field of view is certainly smaller than the Quest 3’s 110 horizontal degrees. That means there are fairly large black borders around what you’re seeing, a bit like you’re looking through binoculars.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>On top of that, there’s a little bit of distortion and vignetting around the edges of the lenses, and you’ll see some green and pink color fringing at the edges as well, especially in bright environments. All of this makes the usable field of view feel even smaller. If you’re looking at something bright or otherwise high contrast — a white text window floating above a dark desert landscape, for example — you’ll see highlights reflecting in the lenses.</p>",

For others it evokes small, minimally outfitted theaters. But black box is also an important term in the world of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://science.howstuffworks.com/artificial-intelligence.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">artificial intelligence</a>.</p><p>AI&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/black-box-AI\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">black boxes</a>&nbsp;refer to AI systems with internal workings that are invisible to the user. You can feed them input and get output, but you cannot examine the system's code or the logic that produced the output.</p><p>Machine learning is the dominant subset of artificial intelligence. It underlies generative AI systems like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://science.howstuffworks.com/chatgpt-news.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ChatGPT</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">DALL-E2.</a>There are three components to machine learning: an algorithm or a set of algorithms, training data and a model. An algorithm is a set of procedures. In machine learning, an algorithm learns to identify patterns after being trained on a large set of examples — the training data. Once a machine-learning algorithm has been trained, the result is a machine-learning model. The model is what people use.</p><p>For example, a machine-learning algorithm could be designed to identify patterns in images, and training data could be images of dogs. The resulting machine-learning model would be a dog spotter. You would feed it an image as input and get as output whether and where in the image a set of pixels represents a dog.</p><p>Any of the three components of a machine-learning system can be hidden, or in a black box. As is often the case, the algorithm is publicly known, which makes putting it in a black box less effective. So to protect their intellectual property, AI developers often put the model in a black box. Another approach software developers take is to obscure the data used to train the model — in other words, put the training data in a black box.</p><p><br></p><p>The opposite of a black box is sometimes referred to as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_testing_dictionary/glass_box_testing.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">glass box</a>. An AI glass box is a system whose algorithms, training data and model are all available for anyone to see. But researchers sometimes characterize aspects of even these as black box.</p><p>That's because researchers&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3pezm/scientists-increasingly-cant-explain-how-ai-works\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">don't fully understand</a>&nbsp;how machine-learning algorithms, particularly&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/what-is-deep-learning\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">deep-learning</a>&nbsp;algorithms, operate. The field of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-explainable-artificial-intelligence-can-help-humans-innovate-151737\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">explainable AI</a>&nbsp;is working to develop algorithms that, while not necessarily glass box, can be better understood by humans.</p><h2><br></h2><h2>Why AI Black Boxes Matter</h2><p>In many cases, there is good reason to be wary of black box machine-learning algorithms and models. Suppose a machine-learning model has made a diagnosis about your health. Would you want the model to be black box or glass box? What about the physician prescribing your course of treatment? Perhaps she would like to know how the model arrived at its decision.</p><p>What if a machine-learning model that determines whether you qualify for a business loan from a bank turns you down? Wouldn't you like to know why? If you did, you could more effectively appeal the decision, or change your situation to increase your chances of getting a loan the next time.</p><p>Black boxes also have important implications for software system security. For years, many people in the computing field thought that keeping software in a black box would prevent hackers from examining it and therefore it would be secure. This assumption has largely been proved wrong because hackers can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reverse%20engineer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reverse-engineer</a>&nbsp;software — that is, build a facsimile by closely observing how a piece of software works — and discover vulnerabilities to exploit.</p><p>If software is in a glass box, then software testers and well-intentioned hackers can examine it and inform the creators of weaknesses, thereby minimizing cyberattacks.</p><p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/saurabh-bagchi-1431873\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Saurabh Bagchi</em></a><em>&nbsp;is a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Purdue University.

Orders open later this week!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>Revolutionizing Amiga Power Solutions</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">PowerShark is a next-generation power adapter for the Amiga line of computers - A500, A600 and A1200. It provides stable, high quality power, perfect for continuous long-term operation of even the most expanded configurations. Utilizing any 12V-capable USB-C power supply for the first stage conversion, PowerShark allows users to tap into a vast array of affordable and readily available “power bricks” for their Amiga system. Furthermore, portable USB-C “chargers” are also supported, bringing the dream of battery-operated Amigas to life. And it works flawlessly with magnetic USB-C adapters, too, ensuring an accident-free environment similar to “MagSafe”.</p><h2>Monitoring and Protection</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">PowerShark continuously monitors the voltage supplied to your Amiga and immediately stops the current flow if even a slight deviation is detected. An extra voltage-sensing circuit ensures the Amiga components remain protected even if PowerShark fails.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The protection circuit is designed for safe unattended operation. If an over- or under-voltage is detected for even a microsecond, or if your Amiga overloads PowerShark due to some internal failure, the device will cut the power and enter a locked-up state that requires a power cycle to reset. No more guessing whether an instability you experienced is due to a software bug or power issues!</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Speaking of power-cycling, doing it too rapidly can be a problem for old computers. That’s why PowerShark prevents it from happening by delaying successive power-up events by a few seconds.</p><h2>Efficiency</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">PowerShark leverages recent advances in integrated power circuits to achieve efficiency surpassing any Amiga power supply in existence (as measured at the mains outlet). When powered off, custom-designed circuits make it “greener” than virtually any other USB-C device on the planet - normally USB-C power supplies turn on and energize the connecting cable as soon a device is plugged on the other end. Not so with PowerShark, which remains “invisible” until you actually flip the power switch. In other words, you can keep it plugged at all times without worrying about your electricity bill.</p><h2>Engineering</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">A glance at PowerShark, inside or outside, will immediately tell you that this is not your father’s power supply. The device sports an astonishingly compact form-factor, barely larger than the power plug you have been using so far, and a shape meticulously designed to ensure safety and ease of access. It’s lightweight, sturdy, and fits in a pocket (yes, that small one in front of your jeans). The circuit boards inside are a marvel of miniaturization, featuring many components barely visible to the naked eye. The entire device radiates polish and finesse. To hold it in your hand is to love it.</p><p><br></p><h2>Technical Data</h2><p>SpecsDetailsDimensions25x27x58mm (0.95\"x1.06\"x2.28\")Current (sustained)15V:4.5A12V:1.0A-12V:0.1ACurrent (peak)25V:6.5A12V:2.0A-12V:0.13AWeight26 g (0.92 oz)PriceTBD1.

The assembly is covered in pyrotechnic material with a safety match-style starter chemical dosed on top. Using the sleeves is simple. First, two stripped wires are fed into either end of the copper tube. The starter the sleeve is then ignited using the box, just like striking a match. The pyrotechnic material then gets red hot, melting the solder and making the connection.</p><p>It’s well worth watching the video to see how these field-expedient devices actually work.

  "Content": "<p><img src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Inflatable.jpg?w=800\"></p><p>Recently, a prototype inflatable space station module built by Sierra Space&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sierraspace.com/newsroom/press-releases/sierra-space-advances-its-revolutionary-commercial-space-station-technology/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">exploded violently on a test stand at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama</a>. Under normal circumstances, this would be a bad thing. But in this case, Sierra was looking forward to blowing up their handiwork. In fact, there was some disappointment when it failed to explode during a previous test run.</p><p><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/inflatable_life_explode.jpg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/inflatable_life_explode.jpg?w=400\"></a></p><p>LIFE Module Burst Test</p><p>That’s because the team at Sierra was looking to find the ultimate bust pressure of their 8.2 meter (26.9 foot) diameter Large Integrated Flexible Environment (LIFE) module — a real-world demonstration of just how much air could be pumped into the expanding structure before it buckled. NASA recommended they shoot for just under 61 PSI, which would be four times the expected operational pressure for a crewed habitat module.</p><p>By the time the full-scale LIFE prototype ripped itself apart, it had an internal pressure of 77 PSI. The results so far seem extremely promising, but Sierra will need to repeat the test at least two more times to be sure their materials and construction techniques can withstand the rigors of spaceflight.</p><p>Sierra is a targeting no earlier than 2026 for an in-space test, but even if they nail the date (always a dubious prospect for cutting edge aerospace projects), they’ll still be about 20 years late to the party. Despite how futuristic the idea of inflatable space stations may seem, NASA first started experimenting with the concept of expandable habitat modules back in the 1990s, and there were practical examples being launched into orbit by the early 2000s.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>NASA TRANSHAB</h2><p>As NASA finalized plans for what we now know as the International Space Station, it was understood that most of the components for the orbiting complex would need to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2021/06/24/iss-gets-roll-out-solar-panels-in-post-shuttle-fix/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fit inside the payload bay of the Space Shuttle</a>. In practice, this meant that Station modules would need to be largely cylindrical in shape, and no longer than approximately 18 m (60 ft). These alone weren’t particularly difficult parameters to work around, as previous space stations from the US and Soviet Union faced similar limitations from their respective launch vehicles. The tricky bit was that the&nbsp;Shuttle’s payload bay was only 4.6 m (15 ft) wide.</p><p><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/inflatable_transhab.jpg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/inflatable_transhab.jpg?w=469\"></a>While this allowed for modules slightly wider than what had been used thus far for&nbsp;<em>Mir</em>, it was a considerable downgrade when compared to the 6.6 m (21.6 ft) diameter&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2015/10/14/hacking-when-it-counts-much-space-station-hacking-saved-skylab/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">“Orbital Workshop” module of Skylab</a>. Seeing this as a potential long-term problem, engineers at NASA turned to an idea that had originally been conceived for a theoretical mission to Mars: an inflatable habitat module that could be packed into the Shuttle’s payload bay and then expanded to its final size of 8 m (26 ft) once in orbit and filled with air.</p><p>The proposed module, known as TransHab, was to be divided into multiple decks providing living and working areas for the astronauts as well as ample storage. There would have been six individual crew cabins, a dedicated workout area, medical facilities, a fully-equipped kitchen, and a large wardroom table that could be used for all-hands meetings or group meals.</p><p>Unfortunately, due to delays and cost overruns on the overall International Space Station program, NASA was ordered to stop R&amp;D on inflatable modules like TransHab in 2000. Construction was instead started on a more simplistic habitation module which could fit inside the Shuttle, but ironically, this too was ultimately canceled.</p><p>Even today, there is no official “habitat” module on the ISS — facilities for the sleeping, eating, and exercising are instead spread throughout the Station.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>BIGELOW AEROSPACE</strong></h2><p>While NASA was forbidden by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/106th-congress/house-bill/1654\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">House Resolution 1654</a>&nbsp;to work on their own inflatable Station modules, the bill did include language that said the space agency could lease such a module if it was built by private industry. Having heard about the cancellation of TransHab, entrepreneur Robert Bigelow contacted the space agency and was able to secure the necessary rights to commercialize the research they had already done on inflatable modules through his company Bigelow Aerospace.</p><p>TransHab development had been largely conceptual at this point, and Bigelow Aerospace spent the next several years taking NASA’s ideas and turning them into a practical test article. One of the improvements they made was the addition of Vectran to the inflatable structure. Twice as strong as Kevlar, this manufactured fiber is spun from a liquid-crystal polymer, and had previously been used in the airbag which allowed&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder</em>&nbsp;to safely land on Mars in 1997.</p><h3><strong>Genesis I</strong></h3><p>In 2006, Bigelow Aerospace had developed NASA’s original concept to the point that they were ready to launch a functioning prototype.</p><p><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/inflatable_genesis.jpg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/inflatable_genesis.jpg?w=400\"></a>The&nbsp;<em>Genesis I</em>&nbsp;module had a length of 4.40 m (14.4 ft), and expanded from its original diameter of 1.60 m (5 ft 3 in) at launch to 2.54 m (8 ft 4 in) in an operation that took roughly 10 seconds to complete. Its solar arrays provided power for onboard diagnostic systems and more than a dozen cameras which recorded the inflation from both inside and outside of the module.</p><p>Designed to operate for six months, the&nbsp;<em>Genesis I</em>&nbsp;module transmitted data back to Bigelow Aerospace for two and a half years before finally going dark. While the onboard systems stopped transmitting useful data, the structure itself remained completely intact with no signs of pressure loss or other degradation.</p><p>Currently,&nbsp;<em>Genesis I</em>&nbsp;remains in a stable 463 x 471 km (287 x 292 mile) orbit at an inclination of 64.5°, and is cataloged as NORAD 9252 and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://in-the-sky.org/spacecraft.php?id=29252\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">COSPAR 2006-029A</a>.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Genesis II</strong></h3><p>Following on the success of their first prototype module, Bigelow Aerospace launched&nbsp;<em>Genesis II</em>&nbsp;a year later in 2007. This second module was largely identical from a external and mechanical standpoint, but added even more cameras, reaction wheels which allowed the module to better orient itself in space, an improved gas inflation system, and an upgraded sensor suite.</p><p>Like its predecessor, Genesis II transmitted data for more than two years, and remains in a very similar 452 x 505 km (280 x 314 mile) orbit. It’s cataloged as NORAD 31789 and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://in-the-sky.org/spacecraft.php?id=31789\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">COSPAR 2007-028A</a>.</p><h3><strong>Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM)</strong></h3><p>After nearly a decade of further development, Bigelow Aerospace finally provided NASA with an inflatable ISS module in 2016. The space agency paid $17.8 million for the module, and it was delivered to the Station inside the unpressurized trunk of a SpaceX Dragon. From there, the Canadarm2 robotic arm was used to attach BEAM to the aft port of the&nbsp;<em>Tranquility</em>&nbsp;module.</p><p><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/inflatable_beam_expand.jpg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/inflatable_beam_expand.jpg\"></a></p><p>Expansion progress of BEAM over seven hours.</p><p>Unlike the twin&nbsp;<em>Genesis</em>&nbsp;modules, BEAM could expand both its length and diameter. When packed into the Dragon’s trunk, it was 2.16 m (7 ft 1 in) long and 2.36 m (7 ft 9 in) in diameter. After an expansion process which took seven hours, it measured 4.01 m (13.2 ft) long with a diameter of 3.23 m (10.6 ft).</p><p>A fully developed inflatable module would have included internal fixtures and equipment, but being a test article, the inside of BEAM was essentially just open space. After monitoring the module for a year, it was decided to use it for storage, and the inside of BEAM was outfitted with cloth bags. Following an engineering assessment in 2019, NASA decided that the module would remain attached to the ISS until at least 2028.</p><p><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/inflatable_beam_expand2.jpg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/inflatable_beam_expand2.jpg\"></a></p><p>ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli inside BEAM</p><p>Unfortunately, Bigelow Aerospace&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2020/04/06/getting-to-space-is-even-harder-during-a-pandemic/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">laid off all of its employees in March 2020</a>, and the company suspended operations entirely in 2021. While no official announcement was ever made, the company is now considered defunct.</p><h2>SIERRA SPACE</h2><p>With Bigelow Aerospace out of the running, Sierra Space has emerged as the new industry leader for space-bound expandable structures. Spun off from Sierra Nevada Corporation in 2021, the company is focused primarily on developing not just the Large Integrated Flexible Environment (LIFE) module, but also the Dream Chaser spaceplane. The end goal is vertical integration — with the Dream Chaser bringing crew and cargo to a space station comprised of LIFE modules.</p><p>Sierra’s multi-layer inflatable technology includes a Vectran “Restraint Layer”, which the company says makes their modules harder than steel once fully inflated. They’ve also developed a way to place openings, such as for windows or air locks, in the inflatable walls of the module while still exceeding the pressure ratings required for certification by NASA. This capability promises to greatly expand the potential functionality of inflatable modules, which previously had only been designed with openings on either end of the cylindrical structure.</p><p><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/inflatable_layers.jpg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/inflatable_layers.jpg?w=800\"></a></p><p>Each layer of the inflatable structure has a specific function.</p><p>The module that Sierra Space destructively tested recently was a full-scale prototype of what the company calls LIFE 1.0: a structure with an inflated volume of 300 m³ that is 6 m (19.6 ft) long with a diameter of 9 m (29.5 ft), and can be launched in a standard 5 m (16.4 ft) payload fairing. This would make it compatible with rockets such as the SpaceX Falcon 9 and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2024/01/09/vulcan-nails-first-flight-but-peregrine-falls-short/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">newly debuted Vulcan</a>&nbsp;from United Launch Alliance.</p><p>The next evolution will be LIFE 2.0, which will double the length of the module to 12 m (39.3 ft) to achieve an inflated volume of 600 m³ while retaining the same diameter to stay compatible with current launch vehicles. Sierra Space also has&nbsp;long-term plans for a LIFE 3.0, a massive 1440 m³ module that would have more usable volume than the entire International Space Station. With a length of 16.2 m (53 ft), an inflated diameter of 11 m (36 ft), and a packed diameter of 7 m (23 ft), putting LIFE 3.0 into orbit would require a next-generation launch vehicle such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2019/03/13/proposed-nasa-budget-signals-changes-to-space-launch-system/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NASA’s SLS Block 1B Cargo</a>, the SpaceX Starship, or the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2021/11/22/blue-origin-rolls-out-test-article-for-next-gen-rocket/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">New Glen from Blue Origin</a>.</p><h2>NEXT STEPS</h2><p><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/inflatable_orbital_reef.jpg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/inflatable_orbital_reef.jpg?w=395\"></a></p><p>Orbital Reef Concept</p><p>According to the press release from Sierra Space, 2024 will be a busy year.

The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.amel.gr/index.php?id=77&amp;L=1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Athens metro system</a>&nbsp;is incredibly easy in Athens and you will only need to make one change from the blue line at Syntagma to the red line and exit Acropolis.</p><blockquote><strong>Note</strong>: The journey takes around 45 minutes, so if you decide to take the metro back to the airport when you leave plan accordingly.</blockquote><h3>Ferry from Greek Islands:</h3><p>Ferries will vary in price if you are coming from another Greek island. I actually came to Athens from Mykonos on a fast ferry for around €50. When you arrive at the port you can get a cab (don’t pay more than €20) and have them drop you off at your hotel or the Acropolis metro if they aren’t familiar.</p><h3>Read More:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theblondeabroad.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-traveling-the-greek-islands/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Helpful Tips for Traveling the Greek Islands</a></h3><p><img src=\"https://www.theblondeabroad.com/wp-content/themes/tba/images/TBA-Post-Separator@2x.png\"></p><p><img src=\"https://theblondeabroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Free-Walking-Tour-in-Athens.jpg\"></p><h2><strong>Day 1:</strong>&nbsp;Get Your Bearings of the City</h2><h3>Walking Tour of Athens</h3><p>I went on a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.viator.com/tours/Athens/Athens-Half-Day-Sightseeing-Tour/d496-31401?eap=brand-subbrand-78069\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">walking tour</a>&nbsp;my first morning in the city so I could get some background info and get a feel for navigating the city. The tour lasted over 3 hours and took us to all of the archeological sites in Athens.</p><p><strong>Our guide was incredibly knowledgeable and gave us really good advice on how to spend our time in Athens.&nbsp;</strong></p><h3>Visit the Acropolis Museum</h3><p>Take an hour or so to get some history and view some of the preserved ruins of the Acropolis. The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theacropolismuseum.gr/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Acropolis Museum</a>&nbsp;is a must-see! The entrance and parts of the museum have glass floors that look down on ancient ruins.<em>&nbsp;(€5/€3 students)</em></p><h3>Lunch at the Acropolis Museum</h3><p>You cannot beat the view from the café at the museum. After you finish exploring the museum be sure to stop in for a bite to eat. It is on the second floor and the outdoor patio looks out to the Acropolis in the distance.</p><p><strong>It is absolutely stunning!</strong></p><p>Also, every Friday night the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theacropolismuseum.gr/en/cafe-restaurant\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Acropolis Museum Café</a>&nbsp;is open until midnight offering a specialty dinner. (Free WiFi)</p><p><img src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201500%201125'%3E%3C/svg%3E\"></p><h3>Stroll the National Gardens &amp; Window Shop</h3><p>Enjoy the beautiful gardens in the late afternoon. They’re fairly small so you can walk through them in under an hour. You can then walk to Syntagma Square and down Ermou Street to the main shopping areas.&nbsp;<em>(Garden entrance free)</em></p><p><img src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201500%20842'%3E%3C/svg%3E\"></p><h3>Greek Dinner</h3><p>Be sure to try a traditional Greek salad and Gyro Pita! It’s cheap, tasty and you can find them on EVERY corner!</p><p><img src=\"https://www.theblondeabroad.com/wp-content/themes/tba/images/TBA-Post-Separator@2x.png\"></p><h2><strong>Day 2</strong>: Start Visiting the Archaeological Sites</h2><h3>Acropolis</h3><p>After breakfast get an early start at the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/3/eh355.jsp?obj_id=2384\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Acropolis</a>. Enter at the South entrance across the street from the Museum and explore the perimeter of the Acropolis on your walk up the Sacred Rock. The whole visit will take anywhere between 1-2 hours.&nbsp;<em>(</em><a href=\"http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/3/eh355.jsp?obj_id=2384\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>More info to buy your pass for all of the sites here €20; €10 for students</em></a><em>)</em></p><p><img src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201408%202112'%3E%3C/svg%3E\"></p><h3>The Ancient Agora</h3><p>Take the north exit and walk down to the Ancient Agora. Parts of it have been beautifully restored and the museum is fantastic.&nbsp;<em>(Included with your pass)</em></p><h3>Cooking Class</h3><p>I didn’t have time to do a cooking class, but I wish I had! This&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.viator.com/tours/Athens/Traditional-Greek-Cooking-Class/d496-49232P1?eap=brand-subbrand-78069\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Traditional Greek cooking class</a>&nbsp;includes a market visit and a full meal.</p><h3>Lunch</h3><p>I grabbed a light lunch of a feta-filled croissant and freddo cappuccino from one of the many cafés across from the Acropolis metro station. It was a good power lunch to keep me going without filling up.</p><p><img src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201500%201125'%3E%3C/svg%3E\"></p><h3>Walk to the Athens Flea Market</h3><p>Check out the cheap souvenir shopping and grab some fresh fruit to snack on. There are little fruit stands all over selling inexpensive cherries, nectarines and pretty much everything you could imagine!</p><h3>Dinner by Recommendation</h3><p>While you’re out during the day, ask some of the shop owners/vendors where they like to eat.&nbsp;<strong>Best advice ever:</strong>&nbsp;Do as the locals do!&nbsp;<em>(Especially with food!)</em></p><p><img src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201500%201125'%3E%3C/svg%3E\"></p><p><img src=\"https://www.theblondeabroad.com/wp-content/themes/tba/images/TBA-Post-Separator@2x.png\"></p><h2>Day 3: Last Day of Sightseeing</h2><h3>The Temple of Olympian Zeus</h3><p>The largest temple of the ancient ruins in Athens and conveniently located in the heart of the city. It won’t take long to visit the site but it is quite impressive. Be sure not to miss it!&nbsp;<em>(Included with your pass)</em></p><p><img src=\"https://theblondeabroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Ruins-in-Athens-4.jpg\"></p><h3>Lunch at Fish Café</h3><p>Located next door to Athens Studios… this place rocks! Honestly one of the best meals I had in Athens. It’s cheap, delicious and they bake their bread fresh every day. Try the veggie or fish burger!</p><h3>The Library of Hadrian</h3><p>The last of the major ancient archeological sites to visit! Be sure to get there with time to visit the museum inside the site. I got there 30 minutes before closing and didn’t have time to check it out.&nbsp;<em>(Included with your pass)</em></p><p><img src=\"https://theblondeabroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Food-in-Athens-1.jpg\"></p><h3>Snack Attack</h3><p>Summertime in Athens is HOT! I ended up there on the hottest day of summer. Luckily, there’s Snoyo! It’s a Greek frozen yogurt shop on the strip across from the Acropolis metro station. Try the plain yogurt with cherry spoon sweets.&nbsp;<strong><em>(To. Die. For.)</em></strong></p><h3>Read More:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theblondeabroad.com/10-local-foods-to-try-in-greece/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">10 Local Foods to Try in Greece</a></h3><p><img src=\"https://www.theblondeabroad.com/wp-content/themes/tba/images/TBA-Post-Separator@2x.png\"></p><p><img src=\"https://theblondeabroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Yogurt-in-Athens-2.jpg\"></p><h2>Helpful Tips for Visiting Athens</h2><h4>Archeological Sites</h4><p>Closed on Sunday and all sites (except the Acropolis) close around 3 pm every day. The Acropolis is open until 7 PM. All sites open at 8 AM. Buy the €20 pass (€10 for students) for entry to all sites.</p><h4>Brush Up on Your Architectural History</h4><p>Well, maybe not&nbsp;<em>necessary</em>. But, at least for a general understanding of how old things really are, refresh yourself on the classical order. Here’s a guide on the three types of columns you will see at the ancient ruins. Doric being the oldest, then Ionic, and then Corinthian.</p><p><a href=\"https://theblondeabroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/wpid-Photo-Jul-31-2012-1128-PM.jpg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://theblondeabroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/wpid-Photo-Jul-31-2012-1128-PM.jpg\"></a></p><h4>The Acropolis Museum is Closed on Mondays</h4><p>Just double-check before you go!</p><h4>Beware of Gypsies</h4><p>While it may sound a bit odd there are a lot of gypsy children around Athens! And they work in pairs. If a child comes up to you asking for money or they are playing an instrument (usually the accordion) it can be to distract you while the other child pickpockets you. Beware!</p><p><img src=\"https://theblondeabroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Ruins-in-Athens-5.jpg\"></p><h4>Allow for Free Time</h4><p>As with all travel, be sure to allow for variations in your schedule. This is just a guideline to help you through some parts of the city, so be sure to spend plenty of time wandering and discovering the city on your own!</p>",

  "Content": "<p>Sunspot numbers are increasing, solar flares and coronal mass ejections are becoming a near daily occurrence, the aurora borealis is frequently being observed at lower latitudes like in the UK, this can only mean one thing… We are reaching solar maximum!</p><p>I lived in northern Finland for 8 months and I’ve lived in the Arctic Circle for many years in total and I often get asked, “When is the best time to see the northern lights in the Arctic Circle?” and my answer is normally, “anytime, as long as the sky is clear and it’s dark.” This is 100% true, if you’re in the aurora zone – the region around the Earth’s poles where the aurora is more frequently observed – you’re automatically in the best place to see the aurora, even if solar activity is low.</p><p>However, if somebody asked me the question, “When is the BEST time to see the northern lights in the Arctic Circle?” Then I would say, “Easy, during solar maximum.” The next question to be asked would most likely be, “But Matt, when is solar maximum?” The answer to that is quite simple…</p><p><strong>NOW!</strong></p><p><img src=\"https://www.theaurorazone.com/images/Luosto5-ruska-aurora_2.JPG\"></p><p>The Sun, our host star, goes through a period of activity where it reaches a peak every 11 years. During this peak, we see an increased number of sunspots on the Sun which in turn release more solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CME’s), if these explosions on the surface of the Sun are Earth directed then the material that is released will reach the Earth in a few days and generate displays of the northern lights in the Earth’s atmosphere.</p><p>The reason the Sun reaches this peak in activity is because its magnetic fields become increasingly more tangled and entwined. They are generated by the motion of the material the Sun is made up of, we call it a plasma, a superheated gas. There comes a point in the cycle where these magnetic fields unravel and that is when the activity calms down and we head towards solar minimum.</p><p>The previous peak was a strange one, but it’s widely accepted that it peaked around 2014, which should make the next solar maximum around 2025… But it seems the Sun has a surprise in store. In the last 12 months there has been a dramatic increase in activity from the Sun and many strong geomagnetic storms. This has caused scientists to revaluate predictions, and many have concluded that solar maximum is in-fact now!</p><p>What does this mean for you and your chances of seeing the aurora borealis? Well, it’s quite simple, if you want to see the northern lights, these next 12 months or this upcoming aurora season is your best chance of seeing these magical dancing lights above your head that have inspired humans for millennia. The number of sunspots on the surface of the sun are at their highest since 2014, geomagnetic storms are becoming much more frequent. If you want to see the aurora like in the viral videos on social media, now is the time.</p><p>And of course, travelling to the Arctic Circle to a destination offered by The Aurora Zone isn’t all about the aurora, there are so many activities to do once you get there and if I’m being honest, these were my favourite part of living in the Arctic. Being pulled through the frozen Arctic forests by huskies is an experience I’ll never forget. The excitement of the dogs as their barks echo through the forest, the freezing air nipping at your face, the feeling of taking part in a mode of transport that has been used in the Arctic for generations is extraordinary. Add to that snowshoeing, snowmobiling, cosy evenings around log fires in purpose built kotas (Arctic forest huts), these next 12 months are the best time to create a memory that will last a lifetime.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.theaurorazone.com/images/Nellim_Husky_safari.jpg\"></p>",

  "Heading": "HOW VENUS ENDED UP WITH A MINI-MOON NAMED ZOOZVE",
  "Content": "<p>A quasi-satellite of Venus has just received an unusual name.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://dq0hsqwjhea1.cloudfront.net/zoozve.jpg\">A solar system poster for children features Zoozve, Venus's temporary mini-moon.</p><p><em>Alex Foster / Latif Nasser</em></p><p>Brian Skiff (Lowell Observatory), who has been a research scientist for almost 50 years, is no stranger to the discovery of new small bodies in the solar system. He has found dozens of asteroids and discovered or co-discovered more than 40 comets, about a dozen of which bear his name. So when he found another fast-moving asteroid while analyzing recent images in the Lowell Observatory Near-Earth Object Search one night in November of 2002, it seemed fairly routine.</p><p>“This thing was going about four degrees a day, so it was obviously a nearby object, given that main-belt asteroids go about a quarter of a degree a day,” Skiff says. As with any fast-mover, he interrupted the regular observing plan to go back for follow-up observations that night, so that the object would not get lost. As usual, he reported the data to the Minor Planet Center. And then he forgot all about it. “Obviously it was just a near-Earth object, and a nice bright one and a nice thing for us. So we moved on and didn’t think anything of it,” he says.</p><p>He didn’t even realize when, a year later, two other astronomers, Seppo Mikkola (Tuerlo Observatory) and Paul Wiegert (U. of Western Ontario), analyzed the object’s orbit and found it was the first of its kind. The object, which had received the temporary designation 2002VE68, is a quasi-moon. It appears to orbit Venus but is in fact not gravitationally bound to it, but rather circles both the planet and the Sun in a complex and ultimately unstable orbit. Calculations show it’ll leave Venus’s influence altogether within about 500 years.</p><p>Such quasi-moon orbits had been predicted as a theoretical possibility way back in 1913, but none had ever actually been seen before. This find therefore represented a whole new class of minor bodies in the solar system. Since then, at least eight others have been found, one of them associated with Neptune and seven of them orbiting alongside Earth. Earth's tally includes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/does-earth-have-new-quasi-moon/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">one mini-moon, found just last year</a>, that appears to have the most stable quasi-satellite orbit yet, with a lifetime of around 4,000 years before it departs Earth's gravitational influence.</p><p><img src=\"https://dq0hsqwjhea1.cloudfront.net/new-quasi-moon-900x600.jpg\">A decades-long timelapse in the Sun-Earth rotating frame (the Sun is yellow, Earth is blue) shows the motion of the quasi-Moon 2023 FW13 near Earth as a green spirograph-like line. Mercury's and Venus's orbits are shown in pink and white, respectively.</p><p><em>Tony Dunn / Twitter</em></p><p>Skiff wasn’t aware of any of this follow-up work until he got a call last year from Latif Nasser, co-host of the popular science podcast Radiolab. Nasser was trying to track down the origin of an odd name he had seen on an artistic poster of the solar system that was hanging on the wall of his two-year-old son’s bedroom. The poster seemed to show that Venus had a moon, whose name was labeled as “zoozve”. Nasser made some calls to astronomers at NASA, who confirmed his suspicion that no, Venus does not have a moon. Perplexed, he kept digging to try to figure out where the odd object with the odd name had come from.</p><p>He eventually tracked down the poster’s creator, artist Alex Foster, in Margate, UK, who was also taken by surprise by the question. They eventually figured out what had happened: Foster had found the name of the asteroid, 2002VE, on a list of solar system moons somewhere online (he doesn’t remember where). When transferring it to his poster, he misread his own handwriting, and instead entered it on the poster as ZOOZVE. Mystery solved.</p><p>“It's a bit surreal and strange to think how it’s all turned out,” Foster says, “all starting with making an error years ago when I made the print.” He adds that “it's affected me so far mostly through a huge amount of orders through my online shop, which I'm very grateful for.”</p><p>But Nasser couldn’t just leave it there. “By then, I don’t know, I had sort of fallen for this thing,” he tells&nbsp;<em>Sky &amp; Telescope</em>. “I think if it had been labeled on the poster as 2002VE, for whatever weird mystical reason, I don’t think I would have fallen in love with it quite as hard as I did.” But somehow the funny-sounding name Zoozve had really struck a chord with him.</p><p>“So I was like, ok, can we actually change it?” Nasser set about learning the somewhat arcane process for the formal naming of asteroids, and asked for Skiff’s help.</p><p>Skiff was initially unimpressed. As the original discoverer, he was authorized to propose an official name for the object, as he had done for many of his previous asteroid discoveries. Once, after discovering four consecutively numbered asteroids in a row, he suggested naming them after the four Beatles. (Name proposals are then submitted to the International Astronomical Union (IAU) for approval.)</p><p>But Zoozve didn’t grab him: “I was like, so would you name it Zoozve?,” Nasser recalls. “And he’s like no, definitely not.”</p><p>Initially crestfallen, Nasser, who is known for his persistence, told Skiff the whole story about the poster and the mistaken reading of the sloppy notes that resulted in the odd name, and about the odd and unusual nature of the object’s orbit — and he won him over. Nasser ended up writing up the formal proposal (which is limited to 360 characters), and Skiff and the observatory agreed to formally submit it to Gareth Williams (Center for Astrophysics, Harvard &amp; Smithsonian), who acts as secretary for the International Astronomical Union’s working group on solar system small-body nomenclature.</p><p>Williams was initially skeptical as well, noting that the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.iau.org/public/themes/naming/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IAU guidelines</a>&nbsp;recommend that names for objects that cross Earth’s orbit be based on mythology. By the time Radiolab’s episode on Zoozve aired, the decision was still not final — two of the committee’s members had not yet voted, and the outcome was too close to call.</p><p>“We were so nervous,” Nasser says, thinking that the uncertainty would be frustrating for the audience. “But it turned out to be a cliffhanger — everybody took it the opposite way. Instead of being unsatisfied, it made people much more invested.” Some people said they kept refreshing the Radiolab website for days to see if there had been any news about the naming.</p><p>And sure enough, after the final votes came in, the name was (narrowly) accepted. On February 5th, the IAU included it on its latest list of new asteroid names. The public’s interest peaked, making that Radiolab episode one of the most-downloaded in the podcast’s last year; their Twitter feed about it has racked up 16.9 million views so far. “It went bananas! A bunch of people told me they’re naming their dogs or cats Zoozve,” Nasser says. Foster, the artist who started it all, is thinking of getting “Zoozve” as his first-ever tattoo.</p><p>The story doesn’t quite end there. Having become so interested in the subject of quasi-moons, Radiolab is about to launch a competition to come up with a new name for one of the at least seven quasi-moons that orbit the Sun alongside Earth. (The only other planet known to have a quasi-moon sharing its orbit is Neptune). While details are still being worked out, one thing is clear: This time, the name really will have to be based on mythology.</p><p><img src=\"https://dq0hsqwjhea1.cloudfront.net/Minimoon-Gemini-v3.jpg\">This image of another temporary mini-moon, 2020 CD3 (center) was obtained with the 8-meter Gemini North telescope on Hawaii’s Mauna Kea. Stars blur relative to the mini-moon, which remained stationary during the exposure since its motion was being tracked.</p><p><em>The International Gemini Observatory / NSF’s National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory / AURA / G. Fedorets</em></p><p>They’re still figuring out the rules, but Nasser says “we don’t want it to be an outright voting contest – we don’t want ‘Moonie McMoonface’” – referring to a naming contest in the UK that resulted in a research ship being named Boaty McBoatface. “My co-host suggested Quasimoondo, which I think is hilarious,” he says.</p><p>Nasser says that part of what excited him about this whole process was the fact that such fascinating new findings as the existence of quasi-moons is still possible. “I just had the idea that science is a textbook, it’s written, it’s published,” he says. “I like the feeling that Earth has a quasi-moon that was just discovered last year. There’s still some pretty basic stuff that we just don’t know about what’s going on, even right around us, that we’re still figuring out!”</p><p><img src=\"https://dq0hsqwjhea1.cloudfront.net/near-earth-asteroid-mi-863x600.jpg\">An artist's impression shows one of Earth's quasi-satellites, Kamo'oalewa, near the Earth-Moon system.</p><p><em>Addy Graham / University of Arizona</em></p><p>Skiff echoes that sentiment. “This is an example of how we live in this tremendously dynamic environment in the solar system. Even though it’s four and a half billion years old, it’s still tremendously dynamic, and we’re finding out about it as we go along.”</p><p>And Nasser delights in the thought that anyone can play a role in the naming process of the quasi-moon in their contest: “For kids, and for adults too, they could be part of that – ‘I’m going to help name a thing that’ll be in a textbook one day!’ It makes you feel like you’re part of the action.”</p>",

  "Content": "<p>A James Webb Space Telescope survey known as PHANGS has revealed exquisite details in 19 nearby galaxies.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://dq0hsqwjhea1.cloudfront.net/PHANGS.jpg\">The PHANGS survey has collected observations of 19 face-on spiral galaxies in near- and mid-infrared light using the James Webb Space Telescope. Near-infrared light reveals light (old stars in the core appear blue). Dust appears in mid-infrared wavelengths, colored red and orange in this image. Dust-encased stellar newborns appear bright red.</p><p><em>NASA / ESA / CSA / STScI / Janice Lee (STScI) / Thomas Williams (Oxford) / PHANGS Team; Designer: Elizabeth Wheatley (STScI)</em></p><p>The exquisitely detailed images of 19 nearby, face-on spiral galaxies come to you via the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) program.More than 150 astronomers of the PHANGS team used the James Webb Space Telescope to study these galaxies.</p><p>While you may have seen an image or three over the past couple years, this is the first time all 19 images are being released at once a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/collections/2041-8205_PHANGS-JWST-First-Results\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">special issue of&nbsp;<em>Astrophysical Journal</em></a>, consisting of 21 separate papers. The images under study show off details as small as 100 light-years across, which means we're seeing structures smaller than massive star formation regions within the Orion Nebula in galaxies tens of millions of light-years away.</p><p>“They’re mind-blowing even for researchers who have studied these same galaxies for decades,” says Janice Lee (STSCI). “Bubbles and filaments are resolved down to the smallest scales ever observed, and tell a story about the star formation cycle.”</p><p><br></p><h2>WE'LL BE COUNTING STARS</h2><p><img src=\"https://dq0hsqwjhea1.cloudfront.net/IC5332-Hubble-Webb.jpg\">Face-on spiral galaxy, IC 5332, is split diagonally in this image: The James Webb Space Telescope’s observations appear at top left, and the Hubble Space Telescope’s at bottom right. Dust that appears dark to Hubble's visible-light and ultraviolet cameras instead appears bright to Webb's infrared detectors. IC 5332 has low surface brightness, making it almost a dwarf galaxy, Sandstrom says.</p><p><em>NASA / ESA / CSA / STScI / Janice Lee (STScI) / Thomas Williams (Oxford) / Rupali Chandar (UToledo) / PHANGS Team;</em></p><p>In these images, Webb's near-infrared camera sees fully formed stars as blue lights. Some of them are older stars gathered in the galaxies' central bulges, while others are scattered along the spiral arms.</p><p>Dust had hidden many of these clusters of stars from visible-light view, so astronomers had previously relied on counting the most massive ones and then making some assumptions about how many smaller ones would accompany them.</p><p>“Now we can go look for the actual embedded young stellar objects and count them up,” explained PHANGS member Karin Sandstrom (University of California, San Diego), who presented some of the collaboration's results at the recent meeting of the American Astronomical Society. A full stellar census will help astronomers understand the whole stellar lifecycle, which can last billions or even trillions of years.</p><p><br></p><h2>DUSTY BUBBLES</h2><p>The mid-infrared images, on the other hand, reveal the glow of dust — especially the presence of complex molecules known as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/acb0cf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons</em></a>. The presence of these molecules acts as a tracer of star formation. Massive newborn stars, still enshrouded in such dust, appear a bright red.</p><p>As striking as the light in these images is, darker regions also intrigue: The outer layers of exploding stars have plowed into the sparse gases between stars, creating dark bubbles large and small amidst the glowing dust.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://dq0hsqwjhea1.cloudfront.net/NGC628-Hubble-Webb.jpg\">Face-on spiral galaxy, NGC 628, is split diagonally in this image: The Webb’s observations appear at top left, and Hubble’s on bottom right. The JWST image reveals&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00811\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">more than 1,700 bubbles</a>.</p><p><em>NASA / ESA / CSA / STScI / Janice Lee (STScI) / Thomas Williams (Oxford) / PHANGS Team</em></p><p>In the spiral galaxy NGC 628, a Herculean effort by postdoctoral researcher Elizabeth Watkins (Heidelberg University, Germany) resulted in the identification of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aca6e4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">more than 1,700 bubbles</a>. What's more, she found that a third of the bigger bubbles had smaller bubbles along their edges. That's a sign that new starbirth was triggered along the dusty bubble walls carved out by older stars' deaths. As stars both form from gas and expel gas when they die, the study of dust-embedded stars and dusty gas in these galaxies will give astronomers insight into how this feedback cycle operates.</p><p>Webb isn't the only powerful telescope to look at these galaxies, just the latest. Images of these galaxies are already available in visible and ultraviolet light from the Hubble Space Telescope as well as the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope’s Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer in Chile. Radio data comes from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, also in Chile.</p>",
